What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

==a hidden file (.git) is created which saves the history of the repository 
i need to do it inorder to be able to use Git as a version control and to tell the device that it is not an ordinary directory as normal directories doesn't save the history of files

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By using :
   git diff --> to compare between the working directory and the staging area to make sure that the change to be committed is logical 

   git diff --staged --> to compare the staging area with the most recent commit also to see the change that is going to be committed before commiting so that we can recongnize if it is a logical change

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

diagrams help to show the parent commit and to easily point out unreachable commits
(fix by git checkout -b new_branch_name)
